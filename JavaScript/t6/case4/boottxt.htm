      align="left" hspace="5">Boothill was opened in 1878 and closed in 
      1884 when the "new" cemetery was established. In those 7 seven short
      years both the good citizens of Tombstone and the rascals found their  
      eternal rest in Boothill. Here you will find the remains of such as
      Tom Waters (shot over the color of his shirt), Billy Clanton, Tom
      McLaury, Frank McLaury (shot at the OK Corral), Margarita (a saloon
      girl stabbed over a man), John Heath (lynched), and Hilly Hicksen (a
      boy who fell from a pair of stilts and died of his injury). At least
      the view is awesome.

      We hope you enjoy your stroll with the people who made the 
      history of Tombstone.
