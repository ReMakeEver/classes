Case 2-1:
	I Would put 10 computers in a group five different times under. Each group would have their own switch.
	Then connect a repeater to each switch. Finally with the five repeaters connecting to the 10 Mbps hub.

Case 2-2:
	I would add a repeater 

Case 2-3:
	Physical topology shows how the actual computers are connected. Logical topology shows how the devices are connected
	to the user.
	Bus topology:
		the topology that is used in which the nodes are connected to one line, and is a half-duplex link.
	Star topology:
		the topology that shows where all inividual nodes connect to a central point.
	Ring topology:
		the topology that shows how the computers are connected, but on one single path.
	Ethernet:
		It is used to directly connect computers to a server. Used to create a LAN netork.
		the networks above are shown how they will connect.
