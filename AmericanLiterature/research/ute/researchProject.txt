The Ute indian tribe was one of the many interesting groups that lived in North America, and have many things that make them more different from all the other tribes. The Ute tribes lived in many places around North America. As well had a unique way that they lived. With a great understanding of how the earth can be used to do amazing things, and how to follow the path of nature. Ending with the modern times the way they live may not be as different as you think. The following is going through great detail of how, who, and what the Ute indian tribe believe in and lived everyday.

Most Ute indians lived in the following states of Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.

The daily life of a Ute indian was not always as easy as their lifestyle made it seem, even though it can appear very simplistic.

Holding a religious belief of the Ute indians was shamanism.

Even though in the beggining of their time of being different from the new American settlers, they aren't really that different from us in these mordern times.
