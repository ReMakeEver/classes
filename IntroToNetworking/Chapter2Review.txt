Intro To Networking 2

Case Projects
Case 2-1:
	To make a fast file transfer speed of a network that has 50 computers that is connected to a 10Mbps hub.
	First I would divide the number of computers to make five groups of 10 computers.
	Then connect both groups to five seperate switches. Then connect the each switch to a 10Mbps hub.
	With the hubs to a switch. Then connect that switch to a router.

Case 2-2:
	Create four LAN networks, each consisting of a 50 workstations.Each group of workstations will have their own server.
	Then within each group will be two switches that group 25 workstations into 1.
	Within each group have a swtich that connects the two other switches and server to 1.
	Then all five groups will connect to one router.

Case 2-3:
	Physical topology consists of linear, star, and tree topology. Wich is specific to a map of the topology.
		Physical topology also shows how wires, and cables are connected.
	Logical topology consists of bus, and ring topology. Which defines how the data should be transfered.
	Physical topology is best to be more detailed on how the network is layed out.

	Bus topology is a logical topology. Where the signal is dampened to make sure the signal does not keep moving.
	
	Star topology is a physical topology. It consists of swtiches grouping together nodes, and computers.
		Then will eventually connect to the router.

	Ring topology is a logical topology. This shows how information is passed along from one another.
		Which is shown in a specific order.
