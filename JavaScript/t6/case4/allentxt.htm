   The Tombstone Vigilantes stage mock gunfights and hangings to the delight 
   of our many tourists. This photo shows a tourist about to be hanged for 
   some offense in front of the Crystal Palace saloon. Don't worry, though, 
   most of our tourists escape unharmed at the end of their visit!</p>

   Today, Allen Street is lined with small shops and art galleries. The 
   shop keepers welcome you and are eager to share some of the old
   Tombstone stories.
